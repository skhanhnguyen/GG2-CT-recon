% SCAN_AND_RECONSTRUCT Simulation of the CT scanning process
%
%  Y = SCAN_AND_RECONSTRUCT(P, material, X, scale, angles, mas, alpha)
%  takes the phantom data in X (samples x samples), scans it using the
%  source P and material information given, as well as the scale (in cm),
%  number of angles, time-current product in mas, and raised-cosine power
%  alpha for filtering. The output Y is the same size as X.

% check inputs

if (nargin<7)
  alpha = 0.001;
end
if (nargin<6)
  mas = 100;
end

% create sinogram from phantom data, with received detector values
Y = ct_scan(P, material, X, scale, angles, mas);
% convert detector values into attenuation values
% Y = ct_calibrate(P, material, Y, scale);
% Filter
% Y = ramp_filter(Y, scale, alpha);
% Back-projection
Y = back_project(Y);
